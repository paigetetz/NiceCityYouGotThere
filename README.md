Nice City You Got There! is a single-page application for exploring information about cities all over the world. It fetches and renders data from the Teleport API, displaying a city's name, a characteristic image, and a brief description, along with Teleport's score data. These scores represent a city's performance on a variety of quality-of-life metrics. The Teleport total score combines these individual category scores into a single, overall value.

When the page loads, it displays information about a random city. The user can click the 'Random City' button to load a different city at random, or use the search form to find a city by name.

The user can save the currently displayed city to the saved cities tray by clicking the button by the city's name. They can return to the display of any saved city later by clicking its token in the tray.
